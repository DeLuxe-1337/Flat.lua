# Flat.lua

Front-end Lua based web framework.

## Features
- Components
- Elements created from Lua
- Easy styling in Lua
- Lua front-end

## Pros
- Easy web-development
- Create websites with only one language
- Lua based, no need to touch JS
- You don't need to use CSS or HTML
- Easy components system so you can easily create the same item mulitple times
- Not bloated, you can still design a lot of the stuff yourself
- Open source
- You don't have to have a good host server, you can use github pages
- FUN!!

## Cons
- Not the best load time (fetching a bunch of lua modules) (I plan to make everything compress into one file later)
- Lua is ran in a VM in JS (not too big of an impact)
- Not the best documentation
- Not a ton of features (yet)
- (Can't think of anything more)
